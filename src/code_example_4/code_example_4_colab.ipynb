    "**Router Agent** (automatic)\n",
    "- Analyzes customer query\n",
    "- Selects the SINGLE best expert\n",
    "- Routes directly to specialist\n",

    "2. **Technical Expert**: Technical problems & bugs\n",

    "\n",
    "**✅ Use Route when:**\n",
    "- You have **specialized experts** for different domains\n",
    "- Each request goes to **ONE expert** only\n",
    "- You need **fast routing decisions**\n",
    "- **No multi-step collaboration** needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this example (Customer Support):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ Specialized experts - Billing, Technical, Account\n",
    "✅ One question → One expert (no collaboration needed)\n",
    "✅ Fast routing - Direct answer from specialist\n",
    "✅ Efficient - No overhead from unnecessary agents\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Sequential: Overhead - don't need all agents for one query\n",
    "❌ Coordinate: Overkill - no planning needed, just route\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world examples:**\n",
    "- Customer support routing (billing → billing expert)\n",
    "- Medical triage (symptoms → specialist doctor)\n",
    "- Legal advice (contract law → contract lawyer)\n",
    "- Technical help desk (bug → developer, account → support)"
